# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview 
This project examines global kickstarter campaigns to better understand campaigns from start to finish. With throughough analysis on current site data, we can uncover trends to mirror successful campaigns in the same category, specifically plays. from In this project, Using Excel, I performed an analysis on current site data to better understand campaigns from start to finish in order to mirror successful ones in the same category.

## Category Outcomes Analysis 
We found that in the US, Theater campaigns are the most common campaign. In the US we find that there were 525 successful kickstarters.

For a deeper analysis, we can look at the subcategories for theatrical productions in the US. In the chart below, we can see that Plays are by far the most common kickstarter campaign with 671 total campaigns. We can also see that plays are largely successful. 61% of plays are successful and only 37% fail. For musicals, only 47% of campaigns are successful and 42% of campaigns fail.

## Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In our analysis, we investigated the outcomes of campaigns based on the launch date of the campaign. In our research, we discovered that May was the month that launched the most successful kickstarter campaigns. Additionally, you can see in the chart below that January, June, July, and October launched the highest number of failed campaigns.

## Descriptive Statistics
To deepen our analysis, we investigated statistcal components for an unbiased view of the data. From our analysis, we are able to determine that failed kickstarter campaigns tend to have a much higher fundraising goal than that of successful kickstarter campaigns. Additionally, the mean and pledged amounts are much lower for failed campaigns than successful pledges. This indicates that failed kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. We can also determine that some large values are driving the distribution of the data sets. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distriution except for failed kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. This means there must be some failed kickstarters with really high goals.

## Great Britain's Theater Market

In our research, we also investigated Great Britain's theater market, especially musicals. To present a big picture of the market, we created a box plot using statistical computations. From the plots, we can see that the mean campaign goal is around 4,000 pounds. This is outsidce the range of outliers for the amount pledged. Half of the campaign goals are less than 2,000 pounds, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
